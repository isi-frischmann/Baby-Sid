# BabySid is an App where Users can book a Nanny immedetaly and Nanny can register to take care of kids

I used Java, SpringBoot, HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS3 and as a database MySQL.

First you can register or login as a babysitter or a parent.

The parent who booked a babysitter can first have a look at her information page. For example, if the babysitter come to the parents house,
if she is coming to the parent house, how many kids she/he take care of and also the contact details.

After booking the babysitter the parent can give reviews for the babysitter and the rating is shown afterwards on the babysitter's page.

BABYSITTER:
The babysitter has to register and also send her Certificate that she/he is allowed to take care of kids. 
Otherwise the babysitter wouldn't be accepted on the program and she/he can't be booked.
